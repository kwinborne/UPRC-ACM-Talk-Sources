# UPRC-ACM-Talk-Sources
Fortran source code demonstrated on September 18th, 2020 in a presentation to the UPRC student chapter of the ACM.

Counts is a device that counts the occurences of letters in a data file, named data.txt

Compiled with GNU Fortran Compiler 10.2.0.

Most files are written in Fortran 90 or newer, but Hello.f77 is intentionally written in Fortran 77.

If you want to use Counts to count a different file, drag it into the folder and rename it "data.txt" and compile the source. For very large files, this can take a little while.
